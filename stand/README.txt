For most uses, "Leg.svg" can simply be laser cut twice.  (But this is not
yet tested...)

The "Leg_Con2.svg" is a second shape specifically meant to fit over the power
cord connected to CON2, instead of CON1.  Since this connector came out of
a Dell laptop, you're probably using the standard barrel CON1 and can thus
ignore this file.
